Infant mortality is the death of an infant before his or her first birthday. Infant mortality rate (IMR) is the number of deaths per 1,000 live births of children under one year of age.
There are number of causes of infant mortality, including poor sanitation, poor water quality, malnourishment of the mother and infant, inadequate prenatal and medical care, and use of infant formula as a breast milk substitute. Contributing to the problem are poor education and limited access to birth control, both of which lead to high numbers of births per mother and short intervals between births. High-frequency births allow less recovery time for mothers.
